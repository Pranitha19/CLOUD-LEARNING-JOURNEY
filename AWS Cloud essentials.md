Week 1: Introduction to Cloud

Learned about different cloud deployment types

Cloud-based deployment : Applications and services are hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and accessed over the internet.

On-premises deployment : Applications are installed and run on servers physically located within the organization's facilities.

Hybrid deployment : A mix of cloud and on-premises infrastructure working together.

Feature	Cloud-Based	On-Premises	Hybrid
Ownership	Cloud Provider	Organization	Shared
Location	Remote	On-site	Both
Control	Low	Full	Partial
Scalability	High	Limited	High (via cloud)
Maintenance	Provider-managed	Organization-managed	Shared
Best For	Fast, cost-effective scaling	High-security needs	Balanced flexibility & control
Learned what is cloud computing and its benefits

On-Demand delivery of it resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Benefits:

Stop guessing capacity: we can dynamically increase the storage or any other services by capacity anytime. With the AWS Cloud, the company can conveniently scale resources up or down based on actual demand, eliminating the need to guess future capacity requirements. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers Go global in minutes: we can use it from anyuwhere in the world just by changing aws region. Trade fixed expense for variable expense: By using the AWS Cloud, businesses can transition from fixed investments to variable costs. With variable costs, customer expenses are better aligned with actual usage, thus creating more financial flexibility.
