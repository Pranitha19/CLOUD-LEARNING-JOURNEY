# CLOUD-LEARNING-JOURNEY
Welcome to my personal learning journal! This repository tracks my progress as I learn and grow in the field of Cloud!
Why I Started
I created this repo to:
- Document everything I learn
- Track my weekly/monthly goals
- Build a habit of consistent progress
- Share my learning path with others

  
# Week 1: Introduction to Cloud
- Learned about different cloud deployment types
  
  Cloud-based deployment : Applications and services are hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and accessed over the internet.
  
  On-premises deployment : Applications are installed and run on servers physically located within the organization's facilities.

  Hybrid deployment : A mix of cloud and on-premises infrastructure working together.

| Feature     | Cloud-Based                  | On-Premises          | Hybrid                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ownership   | Cloud Provider               | Organization         | Shared                         |
| Location    | Remote                       | On-site              | Both                           |
| Control     | Low                          | Full                 | Partial                        |
| Scalability | High                         | Limited              | High (via cloud)               |
| Maintenance | Provider-managed             | Organization-managed | Shared                         |
| Best For    | Fast, cost-effective scaling | High-security needs  | Balanced flexibility & control |
