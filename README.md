# CLOUD-LEARNING-JOURNEY
Welcome to my personal learning journal! This repository tracks my progress as I learn and grow in the field of Cloud!
Why I Started
I created this repo to:
- Document everything I learn
- Track my weekly/monthly goals
- Build a habit of consistent progress
- Share my learning path with others

  
# Week 1: Introduction to Cloud
- Learned about different cloud deployment types
  
  Cloud-based deployment : Applications and services are hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and accessed over the internet.
  
  On-premises deployment : Applications are installed and run on servers physically located within the organization's facilities.

  Hybrid deployment : A mix of cloud and on-premises infrastructure working together.

| Feature     | Cloud-Based                  | On-Premises          | Hybrid                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ownership   | Cloud Provider               | Organization         | Shared                         |
| Location    | Remote                       | On-site              | Both                           |
| Control     | Low                          | Full                 | Partial                        |
| Scalability | High                         | Limited              | High (via cloud)               |
| Maintenance | Provider-managed             | Organization-managed | Shared                         |
| Best For    | Fast, cost-effective scaling | High-security needs  | Balanced flexibility & control |

  
- Learned what is cloud computing and its benefits

  On-Demand delivery of it resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
  
Benefits:

Stop guessing capacity: we can dynamically increase the storage or any other services by capacity anytime. With the AWS Cloud, the company can conveniently scale resources up or down based on actual demand, eliminating the need to guess future capacity requirements.
Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
Go global in minutes: we can use it from anyuwhere in the world just by changing aws region.
Trade fixed expense for variable expense: By using the AWS Cloud, businesses can transition from fixed investments to variable costs. With variable costs, customer expenses are better aligned with actual usage, thus creating more financial flexibility.


Interacting with AWS services

All interactions with services are powered by APIs. You can access these APIs through three primary methods: the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK. Let's review these methods.

The AWS Management Console is a web interface for managing AWS services, offering quick access to services, search functionality, and simplified workflows. With the mobile app, you monitor resources, view alarms, and check billing, supporting multiple logged-in identities at once.
Good for: Users who prefer a visual, easy-to-use interface for managing and configuring AWS services

With the AWS CLI, you manage multiple AWS services directly from the command line across Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can automate tasks through scripts, such as launching EC2 instances.
Good for: Advanced users and developers who need to automate tasks, script actions, and manage AWS resources efficiently from the command line

The AWS SDK simplifies integrating AWS services into your applications by providing APIs for various programming languages. AWS offers documentation and sample code for languages like C++, Java, and .NET to help you get started.
Good for: Developers looking to integrate AWS services into their applications using language-specific APIs

The AWS CLI enables automation through scripting, which is more efficient and reduces manual errors compared to the console.

The customer handles the operating system, networking, and applications on the EC2 instances. AWS manages the hardware.


Compute and shared responsibility

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines the division of duties between the customer and AWS. AWS handles the security of the cloud (hardware and infrastructure), whereas the customer is responsible for security in the cloud (applications, data, and access control).
